He spent 3 years exploring the future of journalism through research and emergent storytelling techniques on the R&D team at [The New York Times](https://rd.nytimes.com/). He's now working on several documentary films mixing verite filmmaking and with RT3D open-worlds while also consulting on emergent technologies such as spatial audio and immersive media.
